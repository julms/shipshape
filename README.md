# shipshape
An open-source program to check quality of new public data.

## Notes
This tool gauges variances between a base and newly updated data set using basic statistics and Gradient Boosted Trees. ShipShape was developed and tested using the 2013 and 2014 household records of the New York Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), available from the Census here -> https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html.

To use, update runner with local file path for both base and new data before executing.
